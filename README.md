# CFPB-
Classification of complaints from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

This is an assignment for my Advanced Data Science II course at JHSPH. 

Data for this project can be found here https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/

Different approaches to NLP and classification based on text data are described here https://smltar.com/stemming.html.

The goal is to predict the type of product - i.e. Vehicle loan, credit card etc. based on the text complaint reported by the consumer.
