Classification of complaints from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

This is an assignment for my Advanced Data Science II course at JHSPH. 

Data for this project can be found here https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/

Different approaches to NLP and classification based on text data are described here https://smltar.com/stemming.html.

The goal is to predict the type of product - i.e. Vehicle loan, credit card etc. based on the text complaint reported by the consumer.

The dates of the complaints range from Nov - 1- 2018 to Nov -1 - 2021. 
That is around 200K complaints for 4 different types of products (Mortgage, cards, vehicle loan, student loan). 

I've included the RMarkdown file that has the code and includes my thought process for the final classification method.
